# DSC-October-Workshop
Introduction to Data Visualization and Feature Engineering in R

### Hi There!

This was a workshop held on the 21st of October, 2020, where I taught a group of underclassmen the basics of Data Visualization and Feature Engineering. This was accomplished by lecturing and leading hands on work on the titanic dataset with R and specifically, tidyverse (dplyr, ggplot, readr). Feel free to download or use any of the files in this repo for reference.
